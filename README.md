🕶️ THE GHOST IN THE MACHINE
“Game Over. Would you like to play again?”

Welcome to the front door of something you weren’t supposed to find — a cipher masquerading as a website, powered by ghosts, signals, and questionable sleep schedules.

What is this?
This is not your average portfolio site.
This is a terminal-flavored, cyberpunk-infused, WarGames-winking experience that rewards the curious and confuses the nosy.

How does it work?
First-time visitors: Solve the cipher. Summon the ghost. Earn the key.

Returning visitors: You’ll be greeted by the system with a single question:
“Game Over. Would you like to play again?”
Your answer determines your fate.

Known Features
A ghost that judges you silently.

A key that doesn’t open anything physical (yet).

More hidden signals than a Cold War numbers station.

Running locally
Just open index.html in your browser. The ghost will find you.
